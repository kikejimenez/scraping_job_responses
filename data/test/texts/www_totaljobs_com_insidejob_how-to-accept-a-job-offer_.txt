It’s easy to get carried away in the excitement, but don’t rush to accept right away.
Responding to a job offer requires careful handling. Particularly if you want time to consider, negotiate salary or terms, or have multiple offers to choose from.
At the same time, employers need to feel that you’re enthusiastic about the job, or the offer may not stay on the table for long.
To help ensure you make the right decision and get the best deal possible, we’ve asked the advice of leading employment experts, including HR professionals at BP, Hilton Worldwide, PepsiCo and Boots.
You’ll also find a range of tools to make the process easier, such as a checklist of questions to ask yourself and the company before accepting a job offer, and a sample acceptance letter.
And if you’re offered a job and decide to turn it down, we’ve got that covered too, with our How to decline a job offer guide.

Accepting a job offer
Asking the employer for time to consider, even if you’re keen on the job, is a good idea.
Doing your research and making sure the role and company is right for you can stop you making a costly mistake. Plus, if you negotiate well at this stage, you could end up with a much better deal.
“Accepting a job offer is a big decision,” says Suzy Style, Head of UK Graduate Resourcing at BP. “If you need additional time to consider an offer, you should ask the employer for a specified amount of time to think about your response, and they will usually be accommodating, provided you stick to the deadline you’ve arranged.”
Don’t worry about asking questions if you need clarification on anything. Employers would much rather resolve any issues now than when you’re a month into the job.
“Think in advance about the types of questions you may want to ask if you’re successful,” advises Leanne Knight, Senior HR Manager for Recruitment at Boots UK. “What would need to be true for you to be delighted and accept, or decide the offer isn’t quite right for you?
“Hopefully you’ll have had the opportunity to have most of your questions answered at interview and you’ll have also had experience of what it may feel to work in the business or organisation, but do you want to know any more about the team, the culture, career opportunities, inductions and the benefits, for example?”
Of course, if you’re lucky enough to be offered exactly what you want, and you’ve done your due diligence and negotiated already, you should accept immediately.
Knowing how to reply to a job offer is important. Not only does it demonstrate that you’re professional, it also sets up a good relationship with your new employer.
There are two ways of accepting an offer: verbally and in writing.
“A job offer will often be made over the phone initially,” says Olivia Hill, AAT Chief HR Officer. “In the first instance, you should thank the person who’s made the call and say that you’re pleased to have received the offer, to show that you’re enthusiastic about the opportunity.
“You can then ask when you’ll receive the offer in writing. This written offer should set out important detail, including the title of the position, your salary, and start date.
“Getting the offer in writing protects you by making everything official, and also allows you to see exactly what you’re signing up for.”
If you receive an offer in writing (without a phone call first), try to speak with someone at the company. This gives you the opportunity to thank them in person and confirm your interest.
Towards the end of a call, you can ask whether there is anything you need to do before your start date, such as fill in any forms, or do any training or orientation.
Thank you letter for job offer / thank you email for job offer
It’s courteous to send a job offer ‘thank you’ letter or email. Even if you haven’t made a decision yet, it shows you’re enthusiastic about the job.
If you want time to consider, ask when they need to know your decision by, presuming this has not been made clear within the offer details.
“Sending a thank you for the job offer acts as a holding device, giving you chance to prepare questions, negotiate, or request a follow-up meeting,” says Heike Guilford, Managing Director of The Coaching Nurse.
Heike suggests thanking the employer for the offer, and saying you would like time to talk it over with your partner or family.
“It’s helpful to give a specific timeframe, as employers may be under pressure to fill the role. Instead of saying, ‘Can I have time to consider it?’ you could say: ‘Thank you so much for offering me this position. Accepting a new job is always a big decision. Could I have a day to talk it over with my partner?’”
There’s nothing wrong with asking for some time. Just be honest about the reasons why, and stick to the date you agree to get back to them.
“Don’t leave an offer on the table too long without responding, as it looks unprofessional and shows a lack of interest. There’ll be other qualified applicants and employers may move on to the next person on the shortlist,” warns Heike.
It’s best not to negotiate when sending a thank you letter for a job offer. Instead, ask to set up a meeting in person or on the phone.
“Negotiating is easier face-to-face, so you can gauge the person’s facial expressions and body language,” says Natalie Reynolds, negotiation expert and CEO of Advantage Spring (a company which offers training on how to negotiate).
If you have more than one job offer, be honest and raise it with the employer as a reason why you need a little longer to consider.
“Having another job offer can help you negotiate a better deal, but this requires careful handling,” says Natalie. “Having said that, you should never invent another job offer as leverage, or a way to buy more time.”

Dear [Hiring Manager’s name],
Many thanks for your call yesterday afternoon offering me the role of Operations Manager, which I was thrilled to receive.
Could you please let me know when you would need confirmation of my acceptance? I would like to do a little more research and set up a meeting with my potential line manager to cover a few points prior to accepting. I am free most days this week after 5pm if that might be convenient?
Once again, many thanks for the opportunity and I look forward to progressing with this soon.

Accepting a job offer with a letter
Once you’ve negotiated, have the offer you want in writing, and are certain that you wish to accept, you can send a written letter of acceptance.
The letter should convey your enthusiasm for the role and include the key terms of employment, such as salary, benefits and job title. You should also state your proposed start date and express your thanks for any special conditions agreed.
Once a written acceptance of a job offer has been sent, it’s important to follow up with the employer. Call the hiring manager / HR department / recruiter to let them know that your letter of acceptance is in the post. You should also call or email anyone else who has been part of the hiring process to keep them informed.
If you have a holiday booked, it’s acceptable to ask to defer your start date. Remember to emphasise how keen you are to join the company, and what you can bring to the role.
An acceptance letter for a job should be business-like, and include your name, address and contact details. Address it to the person who made you the offer, and remember to proofread it before sealing the envelope.
Depending on timescales, you might decide to email a copy of the letter to the employer, letting them know that there’s a hard copy in the post.

I look forward to starting on [start date]. If there’s anything else you need prior to this time, please get in touch.
Thank you again for this opportunity, and I look forward to working with you soon.

Accepting a job offer via email
If you want to accept a job offer by email, use a professional-looking email address. Your own name is best; the employer doesn’t need to know about your nicknames.
Similarly, check your email signature and make sure it’s correct and up to date, or blank if not relevant. If you’re in any doubt, send yourself a test email first.
Include your name in the subject line (“Your Name – Job offer acceptance”). This helps ensure that your message isn’t overlooked in a busy inbox.
All the same rules apply for job offer acceptance emails as for letters above. It’s all too easy to hit send on an email, but remember to proofread it before hitting ‘Send’. Ask a friend to check if necessary.
If you add a read receipt or delivery notification to the email, you can track when it’s been opened or delivered.

How to accept a job offer over the phone
Many employers call ahead to let a candidate know that an offer is on the way. They may use this as an opportunity to test the water on what you would be willing to accept, so it helps to be prepared.
Planning what to say when accepting a job offer will ensure you don’t forget to ask something important.
Note down any questions and key points you want to make, and keep this to hand for when the phone rings.
Don’t feel pressured to accept a job offer immediately over the phone, or to negotiate salary and benefits straight away.
In most circumstances, it’s advisable to thank the employer for their offer, and ask for it to be confirmed in writing.
There isn’t a job offer phone call script as such, as each employer and situation is different. However, preparing how to accept a job offer verbally by making notes is a good idea.
When you discuss a job offer over the phone, negotiate if you feel confident enough, but you may want time to prepare your case, or arrange a meeting in person.
If you’re happy with the offer, say that you’d like to accept, and confirm this in writing, via email or letter. If you accept quickly, this can help put the employer’s mind at ease.
End your telephone conversation by saying, “Thank you again for the offer. I’m very excited about the opportunity. I look forward to receiving it in writing, and if I have any questions, I’ll be in touch.”
Handing in your notice
You need to be happy with the job offer and have it in writing before you resign from your current position.
Make sure you have received, understood and signed all necessary contracts before you hand in your notice.
“Verbal agreements are just that. They do not hold any legal value if things go wrong,” says Heike Guilford of The Coaching Nurse.
Once your acceptance is acknowledged in writing, you can then formally resign.
You’ll find lots of advice on totaljobs on the best ways to do this – including a resignation template letter and a resignation dos and don’ts guide.
Depending on your current employer, be aware that they may make you a counter offer.
Once you’ve accepted in writing, you’ll need to cancel any pending interviews and inform other employers you’ve applied to.
While it’s natural to feel less committed to your soon-to-be-former employer, don’t be tempted to withdraw from day-to-day tasks.
“Remember that even with the job offer, your contract has not changed,” says Heike. “Plus, you never know if you might work with the company or your old manager again, so it’s in your interests to oversee a smooth transition and leave on a positive note.”
It’s a good idea to keep in touch with your new employer during your period of notice, particularly if there’s a large gap before taking up your new job.
Some companies and organisation invite new recruits to team outings prior to the start date, or you could request a tour of the office and meet with your line manager to talk about the immediate priorities for when you join.
“PepsiCo actively encourages candidates to keep in touch with the Talent Acquisition team, their new manager and new team as appropriate,” says Pippa Wallace, HR Business Partner at PepsiCo UK & Ireland.
“Notice periods may be up to three months, so it’s crucial for all parties to keep in touch during this time to ensure a smooth onboarding process.
“PepsiCo managers often meet their new starter before their official start date and we may invite them to attend relevant company events or meetings. If this isn’t possible, regular emails and calls can be enough to feel connected.
“This early engagement establishes open communication and builds a solid relationship from the start to ensure the best possible chance of success.”
How to negotiate a job offer
Most employers expect candidates to come back with questions, and negotiating a job offer is normal procedure at this stage.
“Negotiating better terms post interview happens almost all the time,” says Ben Bengougam of Hilton Worldwide.
“It’s fair for candidates to do that sensibly, I would always want people to feel positive about joining us. In the private sector we almost always have compensation ranges rarely just a strict pay point.”
Be aware that employers are unlikely to go in with their best offer to begin with.
“Just because the company has offered you more than your current position, doesn’t mean they aren’t prepared to go higher,” says negotiation expert, Natalie Spring.
“If you don’t like the idea of negotiating, just imagine that you’re six months into the job when you find out that the person sitting next to you is on £5,000 more, simply because they negotiated and you didn’t.”
Job offer negotiations require a careful balance. You don’t want to sell yourself short, but at the same time, you need to remain positive and pleasant throughout.
“An employer needs to feel that you actually want the job,” says Natalie. “So any negotiation should be in the spirit of trying to make things work for both of you.”
How to negotiate salary
If the job advert didn’t state salary, and it wasn’t mentioned at the interview, the money on offer might come as a surprise.
Remember that your salary is unlikely to change for at least a year (and then is only likely to go up by a few percent) so you have to be happy with it.
Knowing how to accept a job offer and negotiate salary can help you secure a much better package.
“If an employer is keen to hire you, you’re already in a strong position,” says Natalie, who regularly coaches people on how to negotiate salary.
“Before you open the conversation, research your market worth and benefits package carefully. Decide now what you’re willing to be flexible on, and what is non-negotiable for you.
“Asking for extra benefits can add value to your salary, or sweeten the deal if the company is unable to move on money.”
Benefits you may be able to negotiate on include:

Commission / bonus scheme.
Profit sharing scheme or share options.
Paid holidays / annual leave.
Education reimbursement.
Life / health insurance.
Pension.
Company car and / or petrol.
Subsidised travel or season ticket loans.
Flexible working / home working.
Childcare.
Gym membership.
Free or subsidised food and drink.

Find out what people earn at comparable positions at similar-sized companies. This way you can argue that the offered salary is not in-line with competitive market rates.
A good place to start is the totaljobs Salary Checker. It allows you to compare the average pay for any job or industry within any location in the UK. Simply enter your job title and location to see the average salary, plus the highest and lowest rates for that role based on recent job ads on totaljobs.
Next, check to see what similar roles pay on the totaljobs jobs board. With more than 150,000 jobs across a wide range of industries, it’s a great way to see what similar roles pay in your area. Also check relevant industry-specific jobs boards, such as Caterer.com for those in hospitality and CWJobs for IT.
If a recruitment agency has been managing the interview process, you could ask them about the market for the role. They may also agree to take on the salary negotiation on your behalf.
Keep in mind that your potential new employer is likely to negotiate you down, so ask for more than you’re willing to settle at. “Just be realistic,” warns Natalie. “If you’re asking for £10,000 more than the top salary range for the job, you’re unlikely to get it.”
When it comes to negotiating salary, the more prepared you are the better.
Make a note of your career achievements, feedback from previous appraisals, and how you can add value to the company. Be positive and reiterate how much you want the job and what you can offer the company before you state how much you want.
“In the meeting, state the amount you want and don’t apologise or hedge your bets,” says Natalie. “Using soft language, such as ‘I’m looking to get,’ suggests that you lack confidence in your worth. Likewise, don’t say ‘I was hoping for something maybe in the region of £X’. If you have done your research, you know what amount is appropriate, so ask for it.”
Remember, you don’t have to reveal your current salary.
“You could say, ‘I’m not yet earning £X, but having researched the market, that’s what I am looking for in my next role.’”
Keep emotion out of the equation, advises Natalie, and don’t get upset if the employer doesn’t immediately agree to your request. They may need to go away and get sign off before coming back with another offer.
“To negotiate successfully, you need to be prepared to walk away if necessary,” adds Natalie.
However, if the job is perfect apart from the money, be careful not to lose out and later regret it. If the employer can’t improve on pay or benefits, perhaps they would agree to a formal salary review in six months’ time. That would allow you to take the job and come back to the issue of money once in the role.
Making a counter offer
If the employer comes back with an offer you’re not happy with, this is your opportunity to propose a counter offer.
“Start by saying how much you would love to work for the company,” says Natalie. “You need to convince the employer that you’re keen to accept the job, you just need to make the benefits package work for you.”
Take into account the tips above on how to negotiate salary and make sure any counter-offer you propose is well-researched and backed up by the going market rate.
“Likeability plays a big part in negotiation,” says Natalie. “Try to find common ground with the person you’re negotiating with, and be positive and polite throughout. Listen carefully to what they say before trying to make them see things from your point of view.”
“Make it clear why you’re worth £X, or have assigned a certain value to your skills, or certain benefits are important to you, and they’ll be better able to make your case internally,” says Natalie.
An important part of knowing how to negotiate a job offer is to understand who you’re dealing with and what their motivation is.
For example, a recruiter may be working to increase their commission on your salary. An HR Manager may be recruiting several people a week and find it hard to bend the rules. Dealing directly with the MD of a company or someone who directly benefits from you joining may give you more negotiation power.
Once you’ve conveyed your enthusiasm for the role, reiterate why you’re the right person for the job and what value you’ll add to the company.
Be prepared for some difficult questions, such as ‘If we make you this offer, will you accept it?’, or ‘Do you currently have any other offers?’
“Both of these questions are looking to assess how likely you are to accept the offer if they go the extra mile for you,” says Natalie. “The employer might have to bend the rules to meet your requirements, and would only do so with a good degree of faith that you’ll accept the revised offer.”
Don’t lie or mislead the employer, as you may have to backtrack later.
If you feel they are non-negotiable on salary, turn your attention to the benefits on offer. For example, you could ask for increased holiday allowance, or request flexible working.
“Be careful how you handle things at the counter-offer stage,” cautions Natalie. “You don’t want it to seem like you’re just trying to see what you can get.
“Focus on what’s most important to you and negotiate on that. Going in with a long shopping list is only going to make you look greedy.
“Remember, the most successful negations aren’t a battle – they’re a win-win. At the end of the negotiations, both you and the employer need to feel that you’ve gained something of benefit.”
Once you’ve made your counter-offer, ask the employer to get back to you within a (reasonable) time period.
Once your counter offer has been accepted, try to start the job as quickly as possible. Attempting to delay your start date, for example, will look unprofessional.
How hard you negotiate will depend on your current employment situation. If you’re unemployed, you don’t want to negotiate yourself out of the role, but if you have several possibilities and are already in a decent job, you can afford to be selective.
If you accept the revised offer and hand in your notice to your current employer, they may make a counter offer in an attempt to keep you. See our How to ask for a pay rise guide for more advice on getting more money in your current job.
Should you accept a job offer immediately?
Some employers or recruiters will phone you, hoping you’ll accept the job offer straight away. If that happens, see our tips on what to say when you get a job offer.
“It’s almost never a good idea to accept a job offer immediately,” says personal and executive coach Dr Sally Ann Law.
“It’s much more usual to thank the employer for making the offer and then ask for it to be confirmed in writing. Explain that you would like a little time to consider it fully, then ask if the employer has a deadline for receiving the answer. If they give a date, commit to getting back to them well within that time frame.”
Ben Bengougam, Vice President of Human Resources for Hilton Worldwide, warns not to take too long to consider.
“Take 24 hours, 48 hours max. An employer won’t wait for you longer. They will interpret your indecision as lack of interest, or think you’re playing offers from elsewhere against theirs. Either way, they won’t like it.
“If the offer is good enough and you like your prospective employer and direct boss, go for it and say ‘Yes’ fast. Otherwise say ‘Thank you, but no thank you’, but very politely, so that the doors don’t close forever and your reputation as courteous and considerate is protected.”
If you get a job offer over the phone, negotiate on minor details such as your start date if appropriate, but ask for a separate call or meeting to discuss salary and benefits. That way you’ll have time to prepare and have your notes to hand.
Questions to ask before accepting a job offer
There are a number of questions to ask before accepting a job offer.
It’s important to do your due diligence on the company, according to Ben Bengougam of Hilton Worldwide.
“Do a social media trawl of their reputation as an employer. Have they won awards; are they a Great Place to Work (from the GPTW index); are they an accredited Investor in People?
“Then it’s about chemistry. How do you feel about working for the key interviewer, did you relate to them, they to you, what does your instinct tell you?”
Suzy Style, Head of UK Graduate Resourcing at BP, emphasises the importance of matching values.
“Before accepting a job offer you should find out what the organisation’s values are and make sure they fit with yours.
“If you haven’t discussed them in your interview, most companies will share details of their organisational values on their website, so do your research and check that the business you’re joining is as good a fit for you, as you are for it.”
Questions to ask the employer
Don’t be afraid to ask your potential employer questions. Politely asking for more details before you accept demonstrates your commitment and shows you’re taking the decision seriously.
Leanne Knight, Senior HR Manager for Recruitment at Boots UK, says: “Remember, only you can make the decision and make sure it’s the right one for you, both in the short and longer term, so whilst your contract is being sent out, you still have time for any final queries before you make that exciting next step.”
Good questions to ask when offered a job include: ‘Can I meet the team, or the person who is currently employed in the role?’ Similarly, you might ask to see the offices where you’ll work, if this hasn’t been part of the interview process.
This will give you a feel for the workplace – whether the employees seem happy or stressed, and what the office culture is like.
You might also want to ask for a follow-up call or meeting with your new line manager to discuss anything not already covered during the interview process.
Ben Bengougam, Vice President of Human Resources for Hilton Worldwide, suggests making sure you know the answers to the following questions:

How will I know if I’m being successful in the role?
How will success be measured?
How often will I have performance feedback, and coaching sessions if required?
What are the onward career prospects?
What form does the orientation programme take?

Questions to ask yourself
If you’re unsure whether to accept a job, take time to ask yourself some important questions, and be honest in your answers.
“Make sure you’re interested in this job for all the right reasons not the wrong ones,” advises personal and executive coach Dr Sally Ann Law.
“Does the job fit in with your overall vision for yourself and your career, rather than being a stop gap measure to get you out of a job you don’t like? If it’s the latter reason, then it’s probably advisable to wait until a better opportunity comes along. You don’t want to jump out of the frying pan into the fire!
“Ask yourself how well this role fits into your career plans and objectives. Will the job lead you to where you want to be, if it doesn’t immediately fulfil that.”
Questions to ask about a new job include:

Are you genuinely excited about this job offer, not just getting any job offer?
Will it be a good use of your skills and will it offer an appropriate level of challenge, not too demanding or too easy?
Is there a clear job description provided? Do you have a good understanding of the work you’ll be doing every day?
Have you agreed on a job title that accurately describes the work you’ll be doing, fits into the company’s existing structure, and meets your professional goals?
Do you have a set line manager and clear reporting lines?
How will your success be measured? What are the specific goals and outcomes, and how will you be evaluated?
What hours will you be expected to work?
What is the proposed start date, and when does the company need to have your decision by?
Will you be given the tools and training you require for the job?
Is the salary within your expectations (based on your research)? Will it be enough to both cover the bills and provide the necessary progression from your current role? (If not, consider negotiating a higher salary.)
What kind of benefits are on offer? As well as any bonus scheme, you’ll want to review the holiday available, sickness pay, pension plans and any other benefits. Also see how to negotiate your salary.
Are there any financial, location-based or other factors to bear in mind? For example, if the role is better paid but the office is located more centrally, will the extra cost of parking cancel out the rise in salary?
Read the terms and conditions of your employment contract and review the small print. If this isn’t provided with your offer, ask the employer for a copy. It may contain useful information that you wouldn’t be aware of otherwise. For example, is there a probation period that is longer than the norm for your industry, or a long notice period that is required? It’s best to find out sooner rather than later.
It could be a good time to revisit your research from the job interview. Do they appear to be a company that looks after their staff? Do people tend to stay a number of years or is there a high staff turnover? What is the company culture like?
Are there any red flags that make you concerned this might not be the right job for you? Read our checklist of warning signs of a bad job offer.

If you can’t answer the questions above, or still feel doubtful, get in touch with the employer to clarify before accepting the offer.
What are conditional and unconditional offers?
Sometimes the job offer you receive may be termed as conditional or unconditional.
“A conditional offer is a job offer that is valid only if certain conditions are met,” explains Heike Guilford of The Coaching Nurse. “Examples of common conditions are Occupational Health clearance or clean DBS check.” The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check is something employers use to see if candidates applying for certain roles, for example in healthcare or childcare, have a criminal record.
Unconditional offers are just that – job offers without any conditions attached to them.
Conditional offers may refer to satisfactory references, CRB / criminal record checks, a medical exam, proof that you’re entitled to work in the UK, for example. A probation period could also be built into a conditional offer, which must be passed in order to become an official employee.
“Most employers will explain in the interview offer letter what documents you may need. These often include: your passport, household bills, or your driver’s license. You may also want to organise your training certificates in a professional portfolio,” says Heike.
How to handle multiple job offers
If you’re lucky enough to receive more than one job offer, you can use this as a tactical tool to negotiate, but be careful. An employer needs to feel that you’re genuinely interested in working for them, and not just playing them off against a competitor.
If you can’t decide how to reply to a job offer, the Questions to ask before accepting a job section of this guide may help.
You may also want to make a list of the pros and cons of each role.
“Try to weigh up which fits most closely with your overall vision for yourself and your future,” says personal and executive coach Sally-Ann Law.
“Is one role your dream role, but another more practical and a safer option? It might even lead you to choose the one that perhaps pays the least but appears more likely to open up more interesting longer-term options.”
According to Leanne Knight, Senior HR Manager for Recruitment at Boots UK, you should also think about shared values, and listen to your instincts.
“During your interview you’ll have experienced how the business and organisation made you feel. Ask yourself which experience did you enjoy the most and why? Look at the company’s mission and values and the part they play in our society – are these something you can really connect with? After all, we spend many hours in the workplace and believing and feeling a part of a purpose is important.
“Employers want you to make the right choice too. There’s always time for more questions, so don’t hesitate to ask.”
If you’re still not sure, talk the decision through with friends and family, or a mentor or trusted colleague.
I accepted a job offer but now I want to decline
Sometimes you accept a job, bet later decide you want to decline, perhaps because of a better offer, or for personal reasons.
“Turning down a job offer after accepting isn’t ideal. However, if you’ve verbally accepted a job offer, but not yet in writing, it’s possible to decline,’ says personal and executive coach Sally Ann Law.
If that’s the case, let the employer know as soon as possible.
Heike Guilford of The Coaching Nurse, says: “Call them and ask to speak with the person you met at interview. Explain that you would’ve loved to accept the position, but your personal circumstances have changed and you’re no longer able to take the job. Be thankful and apologetic. Ask if there’s the opportunity to apply again in future if your situation changes.”
Declining a job offer after accepting can cause inconvenience and expense to the employer. Being apologetic is not only polite, it also helps protect your reputation.
“Many industries are tightly-knit, and you never know when your paths may cross, or if you may want to work for them in the future,” says Heike.
You should then follow up the phone call by putting your decision in writing.
Rejecting a job offer after accepting is non-reversible, so you need to be 100 percent sure. Once you’re happy with your decision, decline the job offer politely and with honesty and tact. For example, if you’re rejecting a job offer because you took an instant dislike to your prospective line manager, it’s best to keep that information to yourself.
For loads of  advice on rejecting a job offer read our How to reject a job offer guide.
Be clear that this is decision is not a negotiation attempt. If it is, read the section on How to negotiate a job offer above.
Do’s and don’ts of accepting a job offer

Don’t feel pressured into replying to a job offer immediately.
Aim to make your decision within 24-48 hours.
Make sure you express enthusiasm for the role.
Don’t be afraid to ask the employer questions before accepting an offer.
Ask to meet your new manager or team if you’re unsure.
Always ask for a job offer in writing.
Put your decision in writing if you accept over the phone.
Negotiating a job offer successfully requires research.
Don’t negotiate in writing. Do it in person or over the phone.
Research your market worth before asking for more salary.
State the salary you want without hedging or using soft language.
Negotiate on benefits if they can’t move on salary.
Don’t hand in your notice until you’ve signed the new employment contract.
If you decline a job offer after accepting, let the employer know as soon as possible.

	Hi Ana, 
I would ask the human resources department if you can have another assignment or position at that company and hopefully with a nicer manager. Your health comes first. This job sounds very stressful on your body and mind.
Take good care,

	I’m at the crossroads again, of two job offers at the same time. The last time this happened I jumped at the one with the earlier starting date, only to realise it was a mistake. As the job instead of being f/t and permanent teaching post turned out to be associate freelance work under a zero hours contract for one year. Whereas the one that got away was part/time and permanent and in the long run would have meant a steady income until I found something better. So this time round I will delay on accepting the first role without knowing the full details.  Lessons learnt are hard ones when you are over 50.

	This is very good advice. I have been in a position before of not accepting a job offer, for a few reasons and this gave me good advice as to how to handle the situation and if I am on the right track with my decision making and pointers to be aware of.
